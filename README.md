# threeD

Ways to view:

1. Click on the stl file (exported from Mathematica with Lines replaced by Tubes) and view in the Github viewer. Axes and colors are missing, but zoom and pan are nice. Try each of the three tabs in the viewer.

2. Go to this Github "Page" to see the graphic natively displayed by Wolfram, embedded in an Html iframe.
https://jao5.github.io/threeD/
Command drag to zoom. Shift drag to pan. Axes will snap back eventually.

3. Download the Mathematica notebook file (file ends with .nb) and view with the free Wolfram Player app that can be downloaded from https://www.wolfram.com/player/ (desktop and mobile).

4. Possibly in the future: recreate the 3D object in Unity and host the Unity project, exported as Html, here on Github. Possibly view with virtual reality headset.
