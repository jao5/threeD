# threeD

Ways to view:

1. Click on the stl file (as exported from Mathematica with Lines replaced by Tubes) and view in the Github viewer. Axes and colors are missing, but zoom and pan are nice. Try each of the three tabs in the viewer.


2. Go to this Github "Page" to see the graphic natively displayed by Wolfram, embedded in an Html iframe.
https://jao5.github.io/threeD/
Command drag to zoom. Shift drag to pan. Axes will snap back eventually.

(A third way would be a file that can be downloaded and viewed in the Wolfram Player (desktop) app.)
